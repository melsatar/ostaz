Feature: adding an account
 
  As an accountant
  So that I can quickly update account
  I want to see the updated account

Scenario: updating an account
	Given I am an authenticated user, username is "admin@ostaz.com" and password is "12345678"
        Given I am on the homepage
	When I should see "Bank"
        Then the "Bank" within "a_Name" should contain "Edit"
        And I follow "Edit"
	Then I should be on the editing account page
        And I fill in "account_a_amount" with "1000"
        When I press "Update Account"
        Then I should see "Account was successfully updated."
